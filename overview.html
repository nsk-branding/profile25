        <h1>Custom Profile</h1>

        <h2>Hello Gigi! ðŸ˜Š</h2>
        <p>Iâ€™m reaching out because youâ€™ve been gifted a custom profile. I specialize in creating personalized designs,
            and Iâ€™d love to help you create a wonderful profile that reflects your personality and brings your vision to
            life.</p>

        <p>To ensure your profile captures your style and preferences, Iâ€™ve taken a look at your current profile,
            photos, and albums. It seems like you enjoy pastel tones, especially pink, as well as adorable characters,
            fantasy elements, and idyllic, melancholic landscapes. With this in mind, Iâ€™ve designed some preliminary
            ideas to show you and hope you like them.</p>

        <h2>Details</h2>
        <p>We aim to create a profile that truly represents you. Here are a few questions to help us get started:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Color Preferences:</strong> What specific colors do you want to incorporate into your profile?
            </li>
            <li><strong>Theme Selection:</strong> Do you have a particular theme in mind?</li>
            <li><strong>Profile Style:</strong> Would you prefer a personal touch, a more fantasy-inspired look, or a
                mix of both?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Let's Connect on Skype</h2>
        <p>Iâ€™d love for you to add me on Skype so we can share more ideas about colors, themes, and other details youâ€™d
            like. You can add me using this link: <a
                href="https://join.skype.com/invite/a6Ztqvf9GYaE">https://join.skype.com/invite/a6Ztqvf9GYaE</a>. This
            will also make it easier to share progress and any images or certificates you'd like to include in your
            profile.</p>

        <p>Looking forward to hearing from you and making your profile amazing! âœ¨</p>
